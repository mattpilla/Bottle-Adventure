# Bottle Adventure Documentation
> Interactive tool to determine what Bottle Adventure achieves in Majora's Mask

This was intentionally written to work as simple as possible, with no dependencies.\
Since `index.html` works right out of the box, this allows 2 immediate benefits:
1) Anyone can download the contents of this repo and open `index.html` in their browser; no internet connection required
2) GitHub Pages can publish this repo as is: https://mattpilla.github.io/Bottle-Adventure/

## Contribute
Request access to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCOfw-yvR6xpUF8O5zEKxt7HOQNVHN8uteJGpWvdqns/edit?usp=sharing in order to contribute to the documentation.

I included a very simple script to update the data based on the contents of that doc, see the `scripts/` directory.

## TODO
- The only necessary functionality missing is that `data.js` isn't populated with the documentation for what each byte is responsible for
- The above bullet point should be supplemented with a more automated way for people to suggest edits; this documentation should see continuous updates as necessary
- I'd like to add routing so that specific results can be linked to directly
- Write documentation on how to use and benefit from this app
