# Bottle Adventure Documentation
> Interactive tool to determine what Bottle Adventure achieves in Majora's Mask.

This was intentionally written to work as simple as possible, with no dependencies.\
Because of `index.html` working right out of the box, this allows 2 immediate benefits:\
1) Anyone can download the contents of this repo and open `index.html` in their browser; no internet connection required.
2) Github Pages can publish this repo as is: https://mattpilla.github.io/Bottle-Adventure/

## TODO
- Right now the functionality is complete enough, that the only thing that keeps this from being complete is that `data.js` isn't populated with the documentation for what each byte is responsible for.
- Supplement the above bullet point with a more automated way for people to suggest edits. This documentation should see continuous updates as necessary.
- I'd like to add routing so that specific results can be linked to directly.
- Write documentation on how to use and benefit from this app.
